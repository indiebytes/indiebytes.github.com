<p class="intro">It's my 28th birthday and I'm celebrating by publishing the blog I've been about to start for so long now. This will be the first time that I blog in English, so please bear with me.</p>

After some research I decided to give "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/ a try. Up and running in no time!

And I love the fact that I from now on will write blog posts in "Textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ with "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ and simply publish them by pushing to "GitHub":https://github.com/.

The blog won't have any comment form, please make a comment and mention me -- "@andk":http://twitter.com/andk -- on Twitter instead.

h2. Thank you

These people have been my source of inspiration for choosing Jekyll as platform:

* "Tom Preston-Werner":http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html
* "Paul Stamatiou":http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll

... and this guy should get some credits for his "fluid CSS grid"::http://goldengridsystem.com/ that I've started to implement using "Compass":http://compass-style.org:
