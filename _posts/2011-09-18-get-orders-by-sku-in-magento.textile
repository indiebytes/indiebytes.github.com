Recently I have been asked to get orders from Magento based on a certain product's SKU. It's not tricky in any way, just run the following query in MySQL:

{% highlight mysql %}
SELECT tbl_order.increment_id
FROM sales_flat_order_item AS tbl_item
LEFT JOIN sales_flat_order AS tbl_order
    ON tbl_order.entity_id = tbl_item.order_id
WHERE tbl_item.sku = "SKU-12345";
{% endhighlight %}
